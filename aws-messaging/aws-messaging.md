# AWS Messaging Tips

## 1. Consuming SNS messages in your code running on EC2 or other server

**TL;TR** SNS messages cannot be consumed by the code running on the EC2 instance(or other host) directly.

“Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of messages to subscribing endpoints or clients.”

![SNS Overview](https://github.com/szaitsev/aws-notes/blob/master/aws-messaging/images/img10.png)

Conceptually, It sounds exactly like standard ActiveMQ topic, but in reality it does not. SNS is working with predefined type of consumers.
SNS has ability to call HTTP(s) endpoints, so it could be possible to make it deliver messages to the REST-like service. However, it does not allow to use “internal” addresses, basically SNS is not aware of you VPC and routing inside VPC, so you should make your HTTP(S) endpoint publicly available from the internet, which definitely is not working for many cases.
So, the only possible solution to implement consumption of SNS messages is via SQS subscriber. So, the integration will look like this:

## 2. ActiveMQ Virtual Topic Implementation in AWS

Virtual destinations in ActiveMQ are used to decouple producer and consumer(s) even more than regular publish-subscribe pattern.
One of use cases we have right now:
System provides REST service which does some asynchronous processing and need to notify client systems about completion status. Service application sends message to the topic, which has virtual queues attached to it (one per client application), each queue is consumed by single client application. This way producer does not know how many client applications (consumers) are really subscribed and listening, but each consumer guaranteed to get a copy of the message.

Implementation of this pattern in SNS/SQS is just extension of the previous scenario. We just need to subscribe multiple SQS queues (one per application) to the single SNS.

## 3. Standard SQS vs FIFO

When standard queue is used, there are several issues which should be taken into consideration:

- Standard SQS queue does not guarantee the delivery order of the messages
- Standard SQS queue guarantees at least one delivery, accidentally you may receive more than one delivery of the same message.

To avoid these issues SQS FIFO queue can be used, however there are couple additional issues with FIFO itself:

- FIFO SQS queue has lower throughput
- Currently, FIFO SQS queue is not available in all regions.

## 4. SQS Messages Retention Time

Default retention time for message in SQS is 4 days. It can be increased up to 14 days. So, anyone using SQS should be careful and may want to increase default retention time in order to not loose messages.

## 5. SQS Long Polling

Long poling is the mechanism which allows you to reduce number of empty responses from the queue. Each application should utilize long polling in order to preserve system resources and reduce the cost of usage SQS service.

## 6. SNS Message Filtering

SNS allows to define a filter for each subscriber based on the message attributes. It allows to offload systems from the messages they do not really interested in.

## 7. DLQ
Dead-letter queue can be used for SQS messages which have not been consumed succesfully. If consumer of source SQS fails to process message certain number of times, message moves to DLQ. It allows to isolate problem messages and handle their failures. Also, in system with many messages keeping of failed messages till retention period might be cost inefficient. Instead better to move them into DLQ after number of attempts. In FIFO message group is blocked until message is processed successfully. 

* DLQ is not created automatically with SQS. 
* DLQ for standard queue must be standard, the same true for FIFO. 
* message id remains the same for message moved to DLQ
* timestamp is not changed for message moved to DLQ. Best practice to set retention period for DLQ longer than for source queue. Otherwise message will be removed from DLQ earlier than retention period.

Don't use DLQ:
* with standard queue if needed to keep message transmission indefinitely  
* with FIFO if exact order of messages is required
